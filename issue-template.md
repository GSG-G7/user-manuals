## How I get my best work done: 
I focus on the work that needs to be done more than anything, so I put it on my highest priority, I spend a fair time on it depending on the importance of it, I like doing my work in the morning in the first three hours of my day, in a convenient place, where I can think well, so I can produce the best that I can, after I get it done I do a quick recap for it making sure it's nearly perfect, then I share it with others so I can get their opinions about it, so I can improve it even more, after all these steps I can say that my best work is done. :relaxed:

## The role I usually take in a team:  
I don't really have much teamwork experience, but I tried pair programming and it was pretty cool to do :+1:, I didn't have any problems while dealing with others to solve a certain task, I've been once in a team in university, I played the leading role and I was happy with it, but I'm okay with working in any role assigned to.

## My communication style: 
I consider myself a very sociable person, I can be easily friend with people and people finds it easy to be friends with me too, even though I can be shy sometimes while meeting with people whom I don't know. :smile: If I want to get to know someone I just start a conversation with him, I also like kidding with people so I don't consider myself a serious person.

## What I value:
I value other people's opinions and I respect them, so if someone has a stronger or truer point of view than mine, I'm totally okay with that. I also value professional work, great minds, and good personalities.

## What people misunderstand about me:
Most people think of me in the right way and they are never wrong about it, but some people thought think I'm serious which is not me, or some think I'm weak but I'm strong enough more than they can imagine :wink:

## How I like to get my feedback:  
I am positive when someone wants to give me feedback on my work/attitude, it's a really good way to improve my skills and personality, cause words really matter. The best way I prefer for getting feedback is by talking to me directly and explain your thoughts freely.

## Tech Stack:  

## Interests:
I'm interested in new technologies, creative art, cultures, movies, music, photography, and communicate with people from different parts of the world.
